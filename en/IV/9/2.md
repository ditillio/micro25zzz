In <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/en/I/3">Chapter 3</a> we have analyzed the competitive firm's profit maximization problem. In the short run, the firm's optimal choice is

In the long run, if fixed costs are sufficiently low, the profit maximization rule is the same as in the short run; otherwise, the optimal choice is to shut down.
</span>
to produce the quantity of output such that marginal cost equals output price: $MC=P$.

Given that output $Q$ and labor $L$ are linked by a one-to-one relationship, namely the firm's production function $Q=F(L)$, an equivalent way to proceed is to compute the quantity of <i>input</i> that maximizes the firm's profit.


<h2 id="SUBSEC_LD1">Individual Labor Demand</h2>

Instead of inverting the firm's production function and writing the firm's costs and revenues in terms of output $Q$, we can write costs and revenues as a function of the quantity of labor hired by the firm, $L$, as follows:

<p><span style="color: Brown;">
\(\begin{gathered}
 C = FC + WL
\end{gathered}\)
</span></p>

<p><span style="color: Darkgreen;">
\(\begin{gathered}
 R = P\times F(L)
\end{gathered}\)
</span></p>

In the short run, the optimal quantity of labor is the one that maximizes the difference $R-C$. As the quantity of input $L$ increases, the firm's cost increases at a rate equal to the derivative of $C$ with respect to $L$, that we call the firm's <b>Marginal Labor Cost</b>. For a competitive firm, this is simply the daily wage:
<p><span style="color: Brown;">
\(\begin{gathered}
 MLC = \frac{dC}{dL} = W.
\end{gathered}\)
</span></p>
Analogously, the firm's revenue increases at a rate equal to the derivative of $R$ with respect to $L$, which we call the <b>Marginal Labor Revenue</b>, given by the value in euros of the marginal product of labor:
<p><span style="color: Darkgreen;">
\(\begin{gathered}
 MLR = P\times \frac{dF(L)}{dL}=P\times MP_L
\end{gathered}\)
</span></p>
The quantity of input that maximizes the firm's profit is such that $MLR=MLC$:

<p><span style="color: Blue;">
\(\begin{gathered}
 P\times MP_L = W
\end{gathered}\)
</span></p>

In other words, the firm's short-run profit-maximizing choice 
<span class="marginnote">
We have encountered this rule before. Recalling that $MC=W/MP_L$, it is easy to see that the equation derived here is the same as $MC=P$.
</span>
is to hire labor up to the level at which the revenue of an additional unit of labor equals the cost of that unit.

Once we fix the price of the firm's output, $P$, the only two variables left in the equation are the labor price and quantity, namely $W$ and $L$. The equation therefore describes the firm's (short-run) <b>labor demand function</b>: given the firm's technology $Q=F(L)$ and the price $P$ of the good produced by the firm, this function associates each possible wage $W$ with the quantity of labor $L$ that maximizes the firm's profit. 

Let us consider again the example that we discussed in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/en/I/7/1">Chapter 7</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/en/I/8/1">Chapter 8</a>, where the firm's production function is $Q=F(L)=80\sqrt{L}$. Suppose that the price of output is $P=2,50$. The firm's profit is therefore
<p><span>
\(\begin{gathered}
 2,50\times 80\sqrt{L} -WL
\end{gathered}\)
</span></p>
Setting the derivative of this expression with respect to $L$ equal to zero (that is, equating marginal labor revenue $MLR=2,50\times 80/(2\sqrt{L})$ to marginal labor cost $MLC=W$), we obtain the firm's inverse labor demand function
<p><span>
\(\begin{gathered}
 W=\frac{2,50\times 80}{2\sqrt{L}}
\end{gathered}\)
</span></p>
The firm's labor demand function is therefore
<p><span>
\(\begin{gathered}
 L = \frac{10000}{W^2}
\end{gathered}\)
</span></p>
For example,
<span class="marginnote">
We knew already that when $W=64$ and $P=2,50$, the firm's short-run optimal choice is to produce $Q=125$ units of output. See e.g. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/en/I/8/1#gr_RC">Figure 8.3</a> or 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/en/I/8/2#gr_supply1">Figure 8.6</a>.
</span>
at wage $W=64$ the quantity of labor demanded by the firm is $L=10000/64^2$, hence the quantity of output supplied by the firm is $Q=80\sqrt{10000/64^2}=125$.

The figure below illustrates the example discussed above. The figure also shows how the firm's labor demand function varies, as we vary productivity (parameter $A$) or the price of output (parameter $P$).

<h2 id="SUBSEC_LD2">Market Labor Demand</h2>

Labor demand in the entire market is the horizontal sum of the firms' individual labor demand functions, as we illustrate next:

<h2 id="SUBSEC_LEQ">Competitive Equilibrium</h2>

Now that we learned how to construct the market labor demand and supply, we can represent the competitive equilibrium:

<h2 id="SUBSEC_MW1">Minimum Wage</h2>

Suppose that the Government introduces a law that prohibits selling or buying labor at any price below a certain wage $W_0$, a <b>minimum wage</b>. What happens in the labor market as a result of this intervention?

It is easy to see that in a perfectly competitive labor market, the introduction of a minimum wage $W_0$ smaller than the equilibrium wage has no impact on the market. If $W_0$ is instead larger than the equiilibrium wage without intervention, then emplyment will decrease and consequently a dedweight loss will occur.
