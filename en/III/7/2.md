In addition to direct price regulation, the State can intervene in the market through fiscal instruments—taxes and subsidies—with the aim of correcting market failures (such as externalities, which we will discuss in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/it/I/8">Chapter 8</a>) or promoting redistributive objectives. This section explores the effects of these instruments on the equilibrium price, the quantity exchanged, and overall social welfare.

Per-unit taxes, or <b>excise taxes</b>, are levied on each unit

A <i>lump-sum</i> tax (or subsidy), such as one imposed on consumers, has a fixed amount and thus represents a pure reduction (or increase) in income, as discussed for example in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/it/I/2/4">Section 2.4</a> when talking about compensating and equivalent variation.

of a good traded, regardless of its sale price—unlike <i>ad valorem</i> taxes, which are charged as a percentage of the good’s value. This type of intervention alters the incentives faced by both consumers and producers, reducing the quantity traded and creating a wedge—called a <i>tax wedge</i>—between the price paid by consumers and the price actually received by producers. In a competitive market, the introduction of a tax results in a deadweight loss.

To analyze its effects, let us assume the tax is levied on producers: for each unit sold, each firm must pay the State an amount equal to $T$ euros. This is equivalent to an increase in marginal cost of $T$, which causes a parallel upward shift of the individual supply curve and, since the market supply is the horizontal sum of individual supplies, also of the market supply curve.
And what if the tax were imposed on consumers instead? In that case, their willingness to pay would decrease by $T$ euros per unit, resulting in a parallel downward shift of the demand curve.

In both scenarios, the quantity exchanged falls, the price paid by consumers increases, and the price actually received by producers decreases. As shown in the following figure, the market effects are <i>identical</i> in the two cases: what matters is the <i>economic</i> incidence of the tax, not who formally remits it to the State.

[PARAGRAPH ON ECONOMIC INCIDENCE AND DEMAND AND SUPPLY ELASTICITY]

Finally, it is interesting to observe the similarities and differences among the State interventions analyzed so far: price floor, price ceiling, and per-unit tax. As shown in the following figure, all three measures result in a reduction in the quantity traded and a corresponding decrease in total surplus. The main differences between these interventions thus concern the <i>distribution</i> of welfare among economic agents.

<h2 id="subsec_subsidy">Effects of a subsidy</h2>

A <b>subsidy</b> works symmetrically to a tax: instead of imposing a cost on each unit traded, the State provides a transfer—equal to $T$ euros—for each unit sold or purchased. Let us first consider the case where the subsidy is granted to producers: this is equivalent to a reduction in marginal cost of $T$, which shifts the supply curve downward. If the subsidy is instead targeted at consumers, it increases their willingness to pay, shifting the demand curve upward by $T$. In both cases, the market effects are <i>identical</i>: the quantity traded increases, the price actually paid by consumers decreases, and the price received by producers increases.

<a id="gr_public/subsidy"><strong>Figure 7.6 (public/subsidy)</strong></a>
{% include textbook-graph.html graph="public/gr_subsidy" %}

The introduction of a subsidy increases the surplus of both consumers and producers, but it comes at a cost to the State, equal to the amount of the subsidy multiplied by the quantity traded. If the fiscal cost exceeds the gain in private surpluses, the intervention results in a deadweight loss. As with taxes, the final incidence of a subsidy depends on the elasticity of demand and supply, not on who formally receives the transfer.
