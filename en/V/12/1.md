A key assumption of the theory presented in the previous chapters is that all agents have access to the same information relevant to their decisions. As we have seen, this assumption allows us to demonstrate the efficiency of competitive markets, where prices fully reflect preferences, costs, and event probabilities. However, in many markets, information is often distributed unequally between the parties. An <b>informational asymmetry</b> arises when one party involved in an economic transaction possesses information that the other does not. This can impair the proper functioning of the market.

Informational asymmetry can take two forms: <i>adverse selection</i>, which we discuss in this chapter, and <i>moral hazard</i>, which we will cover in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/it/V/13">Chapter 13</a>. Both phenomena were originally observed in insurance markets, where companies recognized the difficulties arising from unequal distribution of information. In particular, before signing the contract, the insurer may be unable to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk clients, and may end up attracting mostly those more prone to claims: this is the problem of adverse selection. After the contract is signed, the insurer cannot observe the behavior of the insured, who may be incentivized to take greater risks relying on the coverage: this is the problem of moral hazard.

In this chapter, we focus on the problem of adverse selection, analyzing it first in the context of the insurance market. In the next section, we will extend the analysis to the labor market, where firms face similar challenges when selecting workers whose productivity is unknown.
<h2>Insurance market with observable heterogeneous risks</h2>

In <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/it/V/11">Chapter 11</a>, we analyzed a competitive insurance market in which all individuals face the same risk of loss. In that context, the contract offered by the insurance company included a premium equal to the expected value of the claim, and each individual decided whether to purchase coverage based on their degree of risk aversion. The resulting equilibrium was efficient: all transactions that generated a net surplus were realized, and the area between the demand curve and the horizontal supply line represented the maximized social surplus.

Now suppose the population consists of two groups of individuals with different levels of risk. Assume that individuals in the first group face a claim probability of $0.3$, while those in the second group face a higher probability of $0.6$. Initial wealth is the same for everyone, equal to $10000$ euros.

Within each group, individuals differ in their degree of risk aversion. As in the previous chapter, this results in a downward-sloping demand function for insurance. Suppose the demand curve for the low-risk group ($0.3$) is:
<p><span style="color: Black;"> \(\begin{gathered} P = 10000 - 2Q_1 \end{gathered}\) </span></p>

and the one for the high-risk group ($0.6$) is:
<p><span style="color: Black;"> \(\begin{gathered} P = 10000 - Q_2 \end{gathered}\) </span></p>

where $P$ is the price of the policy and $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ represent the number of individuals in each group willing to purchase at that price. Consistent with our analysis in the previous chapter, the demand function for the higher-risk group ($0.6$) is higher: as shown in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/it/V/11/2#gr_insurance-demand">Figure 11.4</a>, for a given level of risk aversion, those facing a higher probability of loss assign more value to insurance coverage and are therefore willing to pay more. This explains why, for any given price level $P$, the quantity demanded by the high-risk group is greater.

If insurance companies can observe their clients’ risk levels, two separate markets effectively emerge: one for low-risk individuals and one for high-risk individuals. In both, companies will offer contracts with premiums corresponding to the expected value of the claim: $3000$ for the $0.3$ risk group and $6000$ for the $0.6$ risk group.

[FIGURE 12.1 – EQUILIBRIUM WITH SEPARATE PRICES AND EFFICIENCY]

As in the homogeneous risk case, each individual decides whether to purchase the policy by comparing the price to their willingness to pay. Risk-averse individuals buy it, others do not. Since the price equals the expected cost, insurance companies make no profit. A transaction only occurs if it yields a net benefit for the insured. At equilibrium, social surplus is thus maximized within each group, and therefore overall.

This result shows that the presence of heterogeneous risks does not compromise market efficiency, provided information is symmetric. The market realizes all efficient transactions, and the area between each demand curve and the corresponding fair premium represents the total surplus obtained, which is maximal. This situation provides a useful benchmark for understanding what happens when risk information is no longer observable — that is, in the case of asymmetric information, which we now analyze.
<h2>Heterogeneous and unobservable risks</h2>

Now suppose that the insurance company cannot distinguish between individuals in the two groups. All potential policyholders have initial wealth equal to $10000$, but some face a claim probability of $0.3$ and others $0.6$, and the company <i>cannot observe this</i>. In this context, information is asymmetric.

Unable to offer differentiated premiums, the company must propose a <i>single contract</i> for all. However, at a given premium level, the willingness to insure differs between groups: individuals with higher risk, having greater willingness to pay, are more likely to purchase coverage than those with lower risk.

Because actual demand depends on the premium, and the composition of insured individuals depends on that demand, the equilibrium price must equal the company’s expected cost, calculated based on the composition of its clientele.

We take the same inverse demand functions as above:
<p><span style="color: Black;"> \(\begin{gathered} P = 10000 - 2Q_1 \\ P = 10000 - Q_2 \end{gathered}\) </span></p>

Suppose the premium offered is $5000$. At this price:
<ul> <li>The $0.3$ risk group demands $Q_1 = 2500$ policies</li> <li>The $0.6$ risk group demands $Q_2 = 5000$ policies</li> </ul>

The total number of insured individuals is therefore $7500$, of whom two-thirds belong to the higher-risk group. The average risk among the insured is thus above the population average, and justifies a premium of $5000$: this is where equilibrium occurs.

[FIGURE 12.2 – EQUILIBRIUM WITH UNIFORM PRICE AND DISTORTION]

However, this equilibrium is <i>distorted</i> relative to the case of symmetric information. Some individuals in the $0.3$ risk group, who would previously have found it worthwhile to insure, now exit the market. The composition of demand is skewed toward riskier individuals, and the realized surplus is lower. At equilibrium, not all efficient transactions are carried out, and some inefficient transactions are.

This is the phenomenon of adverse selection: private information leads higher-risk individuals to be overrepresented among the insured, pushing lower-risk individuals out of the market. In extreme cases, this mechanism can generate a downward spiral leading to the complete collapse of the market.
