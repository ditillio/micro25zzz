In the previous section, we saw how an individual makes decisions under uncertainty by evaluating alternatives based on their expected utility. We observed that, if the individual is risk averse, they are willing to give up part of the expected payoff of their wealth in order to reduce exposure to unfavorable events. In this section, we extend the analysis to a market context: the insurance market. We will study the functioning of a competitive market in which insurance companies offer contracts to individuals who are identical in terms of wealth and risk of loss, but differ in their attitude toward risk. We will analyze the equilibrium between supply and demand and see how it allows for efficient risk coverage, maximizing the surplus generated by trade.

Suppose the population consists of many individuals. For simplicity, we assume that all individuals have the same initial wealth, equal to $10000$ euros, and face the same risk: each individual loses all their wealth with probability $p$, and incurs no loss with probability $1-p$. The probability $p$ is the same for everyone and is known to insurance companies. What distinguishes individuals is their attitude toward risk. More precisely, each individual has a utility function of the form $u(W) = W^\pi$, where $\pi$ measures their degree of risk tolerance: individuals with $\pi < 1$ are risk averse, those with $\pi > 1$ are risk loving.

Now consider an insurance contract that guarantees full reimbursement of the loss. How much would an individual with a given value of $\pi$ be willing to pay for it? The upper panel of the following figure provides the answer to this question. Since full coverage guarantees the individual a certain amount equal to $10000$ minus the premium paid to the company, it is worthwhile for the individual to purchase insurance if this certain amount is at least equal to the certainty equivalent of the initial risky situation, $CE$. Therefore, the maximum amount the individual is willing to pay, indicated as $WTP$ in the graph, is equal to $10000 - CE$. As shown in the graph, this willingness to pay can be expressed as the sum of two components:
<ul> <li>The <strong>fair premium</strong>, i.e., the expected value of the loss, denoted as $FP$;</li> <li>The <strong>risk premium</strong>, i.e., the additional amount the individual is willing to pay in order to eliminate the risk, denoted as $RP$.</li> </ul>

In the lower panel of the figure, we represent the willingness to pay for a policy as a function of the parameter $\pi$. Since the risk premium is higher the more risk averse the individual is (that is, the lower the value of $\pi$), it follows that the willingness to pay decreases as $\pi$ increases.

<h2 id="subsec_insurance-supply">Supply and equilibrium</h2>

Starting from the representation of the willingness to pay for insurance as a function of the risk preference parameter (lower panel of Figure 11.4, identical to the left-hand graph in Figure 11.5 below), we can construct a new graph showing the demand curve for insurance policies (right-hand graph in Figure 11.5), that is, the number of individuals willing to purchase a policy, as a function of the price. Since willingness to pay decreases as $\pi$ increases, the demand curve is downward sloping. For simplicity, we assume this curve is linear and given by the equation $P = 10000 - Q$.

On the supply side, we assume that the market is competitive. Thus, insurance companies offer policies at a price equal to the expected value of the reimbursement, making zero profits. Since each individual has a probability $p$ of losing $10000$, the expected loss is $10000p$. The supply curve is therefore a horizontal line at the level of the fair premium: $FP = 10000p$.

Market equilibrium is found at the point where demand and supply intersect. At the price $P = 10000p$, all and only those individuals whose willingness to pay is at least equal to that price choose to buy insurance â€” that is, the risk-averse individuals. Risk-loving individuals choose not to purchase the policy, as they value it less than its price.

This equilibrium is socially efficient. Since the price equals the expected cost, each policy sold generates a net welfare gain for the insured without creating losses for the insurer. Every transaction carried out increases the expected utility of risk-averse individuals without worsening the situation for insurance companies. Conversely, any transaction not carried out (for example, involving individuals who value the policy less than its price) would not have created surplus. In equilibrium, the only agents who remain exposed to risk are:
<ul> <li>the insurance companies, who are risk neutral and therefore indifferent;</li> <li>the individuals with low risk aversion, for whom insurance is not worthwhile.</li> </ul>

The area between the demand curve and the horizontal supply line represents the total surplus generated by the market, and at equilibrium this area is maximized. In summary, the market successfully transfers risk from those who do not tolerate it (the risk-averse) to those who do (the companies), ensuring an efficient redistribution. This result serves as a benchmark that we will use in the next chapter to assess the effects of asymmetric information.
