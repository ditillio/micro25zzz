<h2 id="subsec_bertrand-paradox">Bertrand's Paradox</h2>

bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla 

Several mechanisms help resolve the paradox and explain why, in reality, in oligopolistic markets prices are above marginal cost and firms earn positive profits. Among these mechanisms we find capacity constraints, product differentiation, and repeated interaction over time.
















<h2 id="subsec_bertrand-capacity">Capacity Constraints</h2>

The Bertrand paradox assumes that each firm can serve the entire market demand at the lowest price. This is not realistic: only in certain markets can firms produce unlimited quantities. In many other markets, firms face limits to their productive capacity. In the presence of such constraints, if a firm lowers its price, it still cannot capture the entire market. This reduces the incentive to engage in price wars, since the benefit of a lower price is limited by available capacity. As a result, in equilibrium firms maintain prices above marginal cost and earn positive profits. The equilibrium outcome then resembles that of the Cournot model.

As an example, suppose market demand is given by $Q=5000-1000P$ and that each firm can produce, at a constant marginal cost equal for both, $MC_1=MC_2=2$, any quantity not greater than $800$ units. It is easy to see that, in this context, setting prices equal to marginal cost <i>does not</i> constitute a Nash equilibrium. Consider firm 1. If it assumes that firm 2 is choosing $P_2=2$, its best response would not be $P_1=2$. By announcing a higher price, say $P_1=3$, it would still retain some market share. Firm 2 would sell its full capacity ($800$ units) at price $P_2=2$, leaving a <i>residual demand</i>, that is $Q=(5000-1000P_1)-800$, for firm 1. Firm 1 would also manage to sell its entire capacity, earning a profit equal to $(3-2)\times 800=800$.

What is the equilibrium in this case? Both firms choose the price that allows the market to absorb their total capacity. Since this is $800+800=1600$ units of output, the price both will choose in equilibrium is $P_1=P_2=3.4$, since $1600=5000-1000\times3.4$. Each firm then earns a profit of $(3.4-2)\times800=1120$. No firm will want to set a lower price, since it would still only sell $800$ units and not more, but at a lower price. Nor will it want to set a higher price. To understand why, suppose firm 1 sets a price of $3.4+\varepsilon$. Since this price is higher than that set by firm 2 ($P_2=3.4$), consumers will buy first from the latter, which sells its full capacity. This leaves to firm 1 the residual demand $Q=(5000-1000P_1)-800$, so firm 1’s profit will be:
<p><span style="color: Black;"> \(\begin{gathered} (3.4+\varepsilon-2) \times \big[ 5000-1000(3.4+\varepsilon)-800 \big] \end{gathered}\) </span></p> But this is a decreasing function of $\varepsilon$! 























<h2 id="subsec_bertrand-diff">Non-Homogeneous Goods</h2>

Another factor that limits price competition is product differentiation. If the goods produced by firms are not perfect substitutes for consumers, a price reduction by one firm does not automatically lead to a total loss of demand for its competitors. Each firm thus retains some market power and is able to earn positive profits. We now present a simple example in which price competition with differentiated goods leads to an equilibrium in which price exceeds marginal cost.

Suppose the goods produced by firms 1 and 2 are substitutes, but not homogeneous. To reflect this assumption, we assume that the market demand functions for the goods produced by firms 1 and 2 are respectively:
<p><span style="color: Black;"> \(\begin{gathered} Q_1=5000-2000P_1+1000P_2 \\ Q_2=5000-2000P_2+1000P_1 \end{gathered}\) </span></p> where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the prices chosen by the two firms. The two firms have constant and equal marginal costs: $MC_1=MC_2=2$.

To compute the Nash equilibrium, we write the firms’ profit functions:
<p><span style="color: Black;"> \(\begin{gathered} \Pi_1=(P_1-2)(5000-2000P_1+1000P_2) \\ \Pi_2=(P_2-2)(5000-2000P_2+1000P_1) \end{gathered}\) </span></p>
and maximize the first with respect to $P_1$ and the second with respect to $P_2$, obtaining:


<p><span style="color: Black;"> \(\begin{gathered} 5000-4000P_1+1000P_2+4000=0 \\ 5000-4000P_2+1000P_1+4000=0 \end{gathered}\) </span></p>

The best response functions are therefore: 

<p><span style="color: Black;"> \(\begin{gathered} BR_1: \quad P_1=(9+P_2)/4 \\ BR_2: \quad P_2=(9+P_1)/4 \end{gathered}\) </span></p> 

Solving the system we obtain the Nash equilibrium:

<p><span style="color: Black;"> \(\begin{gathered} P_1=3 \qquad P_2=3 \end{gathered}\) </span></p>

In equilibrium, the profits of the two firms are positive:

<p><span style="color: Black;"> \(\begin{gathered} \Pi_1=\Pi_2=(3-2)(5000-2000\times 3+1000\times 3)=2000 \end{gathered}\) </span></p> 





















<h2 id="subsec_bertrand-collusion">Tacit Collusion</h2>

Finally, even in the presence of homogeneous goods and no capacity constraints, the Bertrand paradox can be overcome if firms interact repeatedly over time. In multi-stage games, which we do not analyze in these notes, firms do not make isolated decisions, but also consider the future consequences of their actions. If a firm lowers its price to increase its market share in the short term, it may become the target of retaliation (such as price wars) by its competitors in later stages. Assuming that firms place sufficient weight on future profits, in equilibrium (of the multi-stage game) they may adopt <b>tacit collusion</b> strategies like the one described above, maintaining high prices over time to maximize long-term profits.
