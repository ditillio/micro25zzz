<p>In the monopoly model examined in the previous section, the price charged by the monopolist is <i>linear</i>: each unit of the good is sold at the same price, regardless of the number of units purchased or the type of buyer. In this section, we extend the analysis by assuming that the monopolist can charge different prices for the same good, depending on the quantity purchased or the characteristics of the consumer. As we will see, this practice, known as <b>price discrimination</b>, allows the monopolist to capture a larger share of the surplus generated by trade.</p>

<p>There are several forms of discrimination, and here we examine two of them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    <b>Perfect</b> discrimination, which occurs when the monopolist is able to charge a different price for each unit sold — a price equal to the consumers' maximum willingness to pay for that unit — in such a way as to capture the <i>entire</i> total surplus;
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    Discrimination <b>based on observable characteristics</b>, which consists in charging different prices to distinct groups of consumers, identifiable based on observable characteristics (such as age or place of residence), but treated uniformly within each group.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

Perfect price discrimination may seem, at first glance, difficult to achieve in practice. Are we really suggesting that the monopolist is able to charge a different price depending on how many units the consumer has <i>already</i> purchased? Although this may be surprising, there are several ways in which the monopolist can achieve exactly that outcome, without explicitly setting a different price for each unit. In what follows, we will examine two pricing strategies—both quite common in the real world—that allow the monopolist to reach the same result: the <b>two-part tariff</b> and <b>bundling</b>.
