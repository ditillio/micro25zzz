It should be clear that a consumer’s willingness to trade one good for another, starting from any given bundle, depends on the slope of the indifference curve at that bundle. The steeper the curve, the greater the number of units of $Y$ the consumer is willing to give up to obtain one more unit of $X$ (or, equivalently, the greater the number of additional units of $Y$ required to convince the consumer to give up one unit of $X$).



<h2 id="SUBSEC_MRS">Marginal Rate of Substitution and Marginal Utilities</h2>

The slope of the indifference curve passing through a given bundle, calculated at that bundle, is the rate at which the consumption of $Y$ must change, as the consumption of $X$ changes—starting from that bundle—in order for the consumer’s utility level to remain constant. The negative of this slope (which is positive, since indifference curves are downward-sloping) is the <b>marginal rate of substitution</b> of $X$ with $Y$, denoted by the symbol <span style="color: Blue;">$MRS_{XY}$</span>.

The convexity of indifference curves implies that, as we move to the right along a given curve, it becomes flatter, and thus the marginal rate of substitution of $X$ with $Y$ becomes smaller. In other words,  preference for variety means that to increase consumption of one good, the consumer is willing to give up larger quantities of the other good when the former is relatively scarce or the latter is relatively abundant.

We illustrate this concept in the figure below, assuming preferences represented by the utility function $U = X^2Y$.

How do we <i>compute</i> the marginal rate of substitution from the utility function? We will now see that the marginal rate of substitution is given by the ratio of the <b>marginal utilities</b> of the two goods at the bundle in question. The marginal utility of a good measures the rate at which utility changes as the consumption of that good changes, holding the consumption of the other good constant.
<span class="marginnote">
Marginal utilities can also be defined for indivisible goods—that is, even when $\Delta X$ and $\Delta Y$ cannot approach zero. Take, for example, the utility function $U = X^2Y$ and suppose both goods are consumed in whole units (like pizza and movie tickets in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/it/I/2/1#gr_consumer/discrete-pref">Figure 2.1</a>). The smallest variation in a good is then “plus or minus one unit.”
Starting, for instance, from the bundle $(2,5)$ and considering a change $\Delta X = +1$, we hold $Y$ fixed at 5 and compute the marginal utility of the third unit of $X$ as $MU_X=(3^2\times 5-2^2\times 5)/1=25$. Taking instead $\Delta X=-1$ we say that the marginal utility of the last unit consumed, namely the second unit, is $MU_X=(1^2\times 5-2^2\times 5)/(-1)=15$, and so on.
</span>
In other words, it is the partial derivative of the utility function with respect to the consumption of that good. The marginal utility of good $X$ at a generic bundle $(X, Y)$ is therefore the limit of the ratio

<p><span style="color: Black;">
\(\begin{gathered}
\frac{U(X+\Delta X,Y)-U(X,Y)}{\Delta X}
\end{gathered}\)
</span></p>

as $\Delta X$ approaches zero, and it is denoted by  <span style="color: Blue;">$MU_{X}$</span>. Similarly, the marginal utility of good  $Y$ is the limit of the ratio

<p><span style="color: Black;">
\(\begin{gathered}
\frac{U(X,Y+\Delta Y)-U(X,Y)}{\Delta Y}
\end{gathered}\)
</span></p>

as $\Delta Y$ approaches zero, and it is denoted by  <span style="color: Blue;">$MU_{Y}$</span>.

As an example, consider the utility function $U=(X+1)^2(Y+1)$. At a generic bundle $(X,Y)$, the marginal utilities are $MU_X=2(X+1)(Y+1)$ and $MU_Y=(X+1)^2$. At bundle $(5,6)$, for instance, we have $MU_X=84$ and $MU_Y=36$. At $(3,2)$ we have $MU_X=24$ e $MU_Y=16$, and so on.

The following figure illustrates the concept of marginal utility (of good $X$).

</span></p>




To understand why this equality always holds, let us once again refer to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/it/I/2/2#gr_consumer/cobb-mrs">Figure 2.7</a>.
Take any bundle $A=(X,Y)$, change the consumption of good $X$ by $\Delta X$ units, and then change the consumption of good $Y$ by an amount $\Delta Y$ such that in bundle $B=(X+\Delta X,Y+\Delta Y)$ the utility is the same as in $A$. We can think of the move from $A$ to $B$ as the result of two steps: first from $A$ to $C=(X+\Delta X,Y)$, and then from $C$ to $B$. The change in utility from $A$ to $B$, which is zero, can then be written as the sum of the utility changes from $A$ to $C$ and from $C$ to $B$:

<p><span style="color: Black;">
\(\begin{gathered}
\overbrace{
\underbrace{ U(X+\Delta X,Y)-U(X,Y) }_{ \text{change in utility from } A \text{ to } C }
+
\underbrace{ U(X+\Delta X,Y+\Delta Y)-U(X+\Delta X,Y) }_{ \text{change in utility from } C \text{ to } B }
}^{ \text{change in utility from } A \text{ to } B }
=
0
\end{gathered}\)
</span></p>

By multiplying and dividing the first term of the sum by $\Delta X$ and the second by $\Delta Y$, and rearranging the terms, we obtain:

<p><span style="color: Black;">
\(\begin{gathered}
-\frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta X}
=
\frac{ \big[ U(X+\Delta X,Y)-U(X,Y) \big] / \Delta X }{ \big[ U(X+\Delta X,Y+\Delta Y)-U(X+\Delta X,Y)\big] / \Delta Y }
\end{gathered}\)
</span></p>

Letting $\Delta X$ (and thus also $\Delta Y$) approach zero, we obtain the desired equality.

Given a utility function of the form $U = (X+\sigma)^\alpha (Y+\sigma)^\beta$, the marginal utilities are:

<p>
  <span style="color: Black;">
\(\begin{gathered}
MU_X
=
\alpha (X+\sigma)^{\alpha-1} (Y+\sigma)^\beta
\qquad
MU_Y
=
\beta (X+\sigma)^{\alpha} (Y+\sigma)^{\beta-1}
\end{gathered}\)
  </span>
</p>

The marginal rate of substitution is therefore:

<p>
  <span style="color: Blue;">
\(\begin{gathered}
MRS_{XY}
=
\frac{\alpha}{\beta} \times \frac{Y+\sigma}{X+\sigma}
\end{gathered}\)
  </span>
</p>


The figure below illustrates the calculation of marginal utilities and the marginal rate of substitution. As can be seen, the indifference curves are steeper (the marginal rate of substitution is higher) the larger the ratio $\alpha/\beta$. This makes sense, since this ratio reflects the relative importance of $X$ compared to $Y$ and, therefore, the rate at which the consumer is willing to trade $X$ for $Y$.

The parameter $\sigma$, on the other hand, reflects the lower or higher substitutability between the goods. A high value of $\sigma$ describes a consumer who has only a slight preference for variety, meaning they can always easily substitute one good, even if scarce, with the other good. The higher $\sigma$ is, the less convex and more like straight lines the indifference curves will be. In other words, the marginal rate of substitution will vary less from bundle to bundle, never tending to zero or infinity (as happens when $\sigma=0$). Put differently, a good will never be considered so scarce as to make the consumer willing to give up large quantities of the other good to obtain more of it.
